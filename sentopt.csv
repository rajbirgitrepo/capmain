That was a challenging exploration into kindness….feelings….acceptance….and reflection. I am so surprised, when people are kind to me….it shouldn’t be that way…people should be kind all the time…but they’re not. It doesn’t matter…I am not going to STOP being kind to others.

Thank you and God bless.

Thank you for the reminder, about the importance of keeping our eyes closed during our practice sessions. I have A.D.D. & OCD and I find myself wanting to clean or see something that needs to be done in the classroom when my eyes are open, it is so difficult not to act.
When I close my eyes it much easier for me to stay focused on the mindful practice.
Again thank you for trying to keep us focused and mindful.

5474,I noticed how hard it is sometimes to allow  myself to relax and do the minefulness practice.  All these judgements keep coming into my mind.  Why is it so hard to love my way back to me?  Why is it so easy to hate my way to productivity.  Why don't I believe that loving my way back to me is the best way to create the best version of myself?  Instead I have this White Anglo Saxon Protestant uptight belief that self flagellation and self anger and self hatred is the best course of action to self perfection.  I want to change but change is so difficult when the habit is so entrenched.  I am sad.  ,0.157,0.169,0.675,-0.5603
